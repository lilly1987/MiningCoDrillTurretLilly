# GitHub Copilot Instructions for MiningCo. DrillTurret (Continued)

## Mod Overview and Purpose
The **MiningCo. DrillTurret (Continued)** mod revisits and updates Rikiki's original concept of a versatile drill turret designed for RimWorld. This mod introduces a sophisticated drill turret, capable of autonomously mining nearby ores and natural rocks, enhancing gameplay by streamlining resource gathering operations. Incorporating the drill turret in your RimWorld colony utilities the technological advancements of MiningCo.'s expeditions, making your settlements more efficient and self-sustaining.

## Key Features and Systems
- **Drill Turret Implementation:** A new turret type that can automatically extract ores and rocks from its surroundings.
- **Mining Mode Flexibility:** Players can switch the drill turret's mining mode to focus on only ores, only rocks, or a combination of both.
- **Efficiency Boost:** Manning the turret enhances its mining speed, with a level 20 miner achieving double the normal rate.
- **Research Upgrades:** Enhancements to drilling efficiency and resource yield are possible through additional research projects, allowing for further optimization of the turret's capabilities.

## Coding Patterns and Conventions
- **Class Utilization:** Utilization of C# classes like `Building_DrillTurret` and `JobDriver_OperateDrillTurret` is central to the mod, encapsulating distinct functionalities related to the drill turret's operations.
- **Method Encapsulation:** Key functionalities are encapsulated within methods such as `resetTarget()`, `computeDrillEfficiency()`, and `switchMiningMode()`, promoting modular design and easier maintenance.
- **Naming Conventions:** The mod follows PascalCase for public methods and classes, and camelCase for private methods, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

## XML Integration
- **Object Definitions:** XML files are used to define the turret's properties, such as its stats, costs, and research requirements. Ensure these are aligned with your C# classes to maintain consistency in the game's database.
- **Patch Operations:** XML patching techniques are employed to integrate the new drill turret seamlessly without altering the core game files directly, reducing the risk of conflicts with other mods.

## Harmony Patching
- **Purpose:** Harmony is used for runtime method patching, facilitating mod integration without altering the original game code.
- **Application:** Make sure to identify methods in the vanilla game that your mod interacts with or overrides, and apply Harmony patches accordingly to inject or modify behavior.

## Suggestions for Copilot
- **Pattern Recognition:** When writing new features, leverage Copilot's ability to recognize established patterns from existing methods, such as `computeDrillEfficiency()` and `lookForNewTarget()`, to generate similar functionalities.
- **Code Consistency:** Ensure Copilot-generated code adheres to the mod's established coding conventions for readability and maintainability.
- **Dynamic Texture Drawing:** Utilize Copilot to explore and implement dynamic transparent texture drawing, enhancing the visual presentation of the drill turret's mining effects.
- **Efficiency Enhancements:** Use Copilot's suggestions to identify potential optimization in terms of code performance, especially in frequently called methods like `startOrMaintainLaserDrillEffecter()`.

By adhering to these guidelines and leveraging GitHub Copilot's capabilities, you can efficiently manage and enhance the MiningCo. DrillTurret mod, ensuring it remains a valuable asset for RimWorld enthusiasts.
